- **Natural Language AWS Management**: Control AWS resources using plain English
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform integration for reproducible deployments
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: PostgreSQL-based tracking of all operations
- **Cost Analysis & Visualization**: Generate cost reports and graphs
- **RAG-Enhanced Responses**: Knowledge base for AWS best practices using ChromaDB
- **Multi-Service Support**: EC2, S3, Cost Explorer, and generic AWS commands
- **Interactive Session Management**: Maintains context across conversations

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Terraform (optional, for IaC features)
- Ollama with Granite 3.3 model

# Pull the Granite 3.3 model
ollama pull granite3.3
```

### 6. (Optional) Install Terraform

For Infrastructure as Code features:

```bash
# macOS
brew install terraform

# Linux
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

## üöÄ Running the Service

### Start the AWS MCP Server

```bash
python aws_mcp_server.py
```

### Connect with the Enhanced Client

In a new terminal:

```bash
python aws_client_enhanced.py aws_mcp_server.py

üîß AWS Console> Create a t2.micro EC2 instance with Ubuntu

‚è≥ Processing...

I'll help you create a t2.micro EC2 instance with Ubuntu. Let me set that up for you using Terraform for better infrastructure management.

---TOOL_START---
TOOL: create_ec2_instance
INPUT: {"instance_type": "t2.micro", "name": "ubuntu-server", "use_terraform": true}
---TOOL_END---

[Tool create_ec2_instance executed]

‚úÖ Great! I've successfully created your EC2 instance with the following details:

- **Instance Type**: t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM - Free tier eligible)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- **Instance ID**: i-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
- **Public IP**: 54.123.45.67

The instance is now launching and should be ready in about 1-2 minutes. This t2.micro instance is eligible for the AWS free tier, which includes 750 hours per month for the first 12 months.

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to connect to this instance via SSH?
2. Set up security group rules for specific access?
3. Create additional instances?
```

```
üîß AWS Console> What's my AWS cost for the last 3 months?

‚è≥ Processing...

I'll analyze your AWS costs for the last 3 months and provide you with a detailed breakdown.

---TOOL_START---
TOOL: get_cost_analysis
INPUT: {"start_date": "2025-01-01", "end_date": "2025-03-31", "granularity": "MONTHLY", "generate_graph": true}
---TOOL_END---

[Tool get_cost_analysis executed]

üí∞ Here's your AWS cost analysis for the last 3 months:

**Total Cost**: $342.56

**Monthly Breakdown**:
- January 2025: $125.43
- February 2025: $112.78
- March 2025: $104.35

**Top Services by Cost**:
1. Amazon EC2: $185.23 (54%)
2. Amazon S3: $67.89 (20%)
3. Amazon RDS: $45.12 (13%)
4. AWS Lambda: $23.45 (7%)
5. Other services: $20.87 (6%)

üìä A visual cost chart has been generated and saved. 

**Cost Optimization Recommendations**:
1. Your EC2 costs are the highest - consider using Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
2. Review and terminate any unused EC2 instances
3. Enable S3 lifecycle policies to move infrequent data to cheaper storage classes
4. Set up AWS Budgets to get alerts before exceeding thresholds

Would you like me to help you implement any of these cost-saving measures?
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **FastMCP**: Server framework for tool exposure
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID-compliant database for audit logs and state
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for AWS resources
- **Ollama + Granite 3.3**: LLM for natural language processing
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for RAG functionality
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python

### Why These Technologies?

1. **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**: 
   - ACID compliance for financial and audit data
   - Strong consistency for operation logs
   - Structured queries for reporting
   - Native JSON support for flexible data

2. **Terraform for IaC**:
   - Industry standard for infrastructure management
   - State management and drift detection
   - Declarative configuration
   - Multi-provider support

3. **ChromaDB for RAG**:
   - Persistent client for knowledge base storage
   - Good performance for small-medium knowledge bases
   - Easy integration with Python

4. **Plotly for Visualization**:
   - Interactive charts
   - JSON serialization for storage
   - Wide variety of chart types

## üìä Database Schema

### aws_operations
- Tracks all AWS operations performed
- Includes parameters, results, and execution metrics
- Used for audit trails and debugging

### terraform_states
- Stores Terraform configurations and state
- Enables infrastructure versioning
- Supports rollback capabilities

### cost_data
- Caches AWS Cost Explorer data
- Enables historical cost analysis
- Supports custom cost reports

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Management**:
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use IAM roles in production
   - Implement least-privilege policies

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use SSL connections
   - Implement row-level security
   - Regular backups

3. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting on operations
   - Input validation
   - Audit logging

## üöß Limitations

- Single-region support per configuration
- Synchronous tool execution
- Limited to configured AWS services
- Requires manual Ollama model setup

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-region support
- [ ] Real-time cost alerts
- [ ] CloudFormation integration
- [ ] AWS Organizations support
- [ ] Web UI interface
- [ ] Scheduled operations
- [ ] Advanced IAM management
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery automation
